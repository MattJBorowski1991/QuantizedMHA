          The memory access pattern for global loads from L1TEX might not be optimal. On average, only 12.8 of the 32   
          bytes transmitted per sector are utilized by each thread. This could possibly be caused by a stride between   
          threads. Check the Source Counters section for uncoalesced global loads.

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this workload each scheduler only    
          issues an instruction every 2.7 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 12 warps per scheduler, this workload allocates an average    
          of 11.76 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.56 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible      
          warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no      
          eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the       
          number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per      
          warp. Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

          On average, each warp of this workload spends 15.9 cycles being stalled waiting for the MIO (memory           
          input/output) instruction queue to be not full. This stall reason is high in cases of extreme utilization of  
          the MIO pipelines, which include special math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory        
          instructions. When caused by shared memory accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline  
          pressure. This stall type represents about 49.5% of the total average of 32.2 cycles between issuing two      
          instructions.

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this workload each scheduler only    
          issues an instruction every 4.1 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 12 warps per scheduler, this workload allocates an average

          warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no      
          eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the

          A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 2 full waves and a partial wave of 328 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, this partial wave may account for  
          up to 33.3% of the total runtime of this kernel. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall       
          impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid. See the Hardware   
          Model (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#metrics-hw-model) description for     
          more details on launch configurations.

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this workload each scheduler only    
          issues an instruction every 2.0 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 12 warps per scheduler, this workload allocates an average    
          of 4.46 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.36 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible       
          warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no      
          eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the       
          number of eligible warps, reduce the time the active warps are stalled by inspecting the top stall reasons    
          on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections.

          Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This workload achieves an average of 16.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced  
          to 14.9 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible.

          The difference between calculated theoretical (66.7%) and measured achieved occupancy (37.1%) can be the      
          result of warp scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can   
          occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices

          The 8.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 12. This kernel's theoretical occupancy (66.7%) is limited by the number of required      
          registers, and the required amount of shared memory.

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this workload each scheduler only    
          issues an instruction every 3.7 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 12 warps per scheduler, this workload allocates an average    
          of 8.72 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.47 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible       
          warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no      
          eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the       
          number of eligible warps, reduce the time the active warps are stalled by inspecting the top stall reasons

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this workload each scheduler only    
          issues an instruction every 3.7 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 12 warps per scheduler, this workload allocates an average    
          of 8.65 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.46 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible       
          warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no      
          eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the       
          number of eligible warps, reduce the time the active warps are stalled by inspecting the top stall reasons    
          on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections.

          increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration. Consider moving frequently

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this workload each scheduler only    
          issues an instruction every 3.6 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 12 warps per scheduler, this workload allocates an average    
          of 9.30 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.46 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible       
          warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no      
          eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the       
          number of eligible warps, reduce the time the active warps are stalled by inspecting the top stall reasons    
          on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections.

          On average, each warp of this workload spends 18.7 cycles being stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency   
          on a L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture) operation. Find the instruction producing the data being waited  
          upon to identify the culprit. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the        
          memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by        
          increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration. Consider moving frequently     
          used data to shared memory. This stall type represents about 56.1% of the total average of 33.4 cycles

          A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 2 full waves and a partial wave of 328 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, this partial wave may account for  
          up to 33.3% of the total runtime of this kernel. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall       
          impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid. See the Hardware   
          Model (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#metrics-hw-model) description for

          occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices

          Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This workload achieves an average of 13.6 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced  
          to 12.9 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible.

    OPT   If you execute __syncthreads() to synchronize the threads of a block, it is recommended to have at least two  
          blocks per multiprocessor (compared to the currently executed 1.1 blocks) This way, blocks that aren't        
          waiting for __syncthreads() can keep the hardware busy.

          The difference between calculated theoretical (66.7%) and measured achieved occupancy (36.9%) can be the

          The 8.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the
