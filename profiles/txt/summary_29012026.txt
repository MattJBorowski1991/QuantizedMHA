Elapsed cycles of ops: 

(mutual to all mha_kernels)
3 x Exctract = 3 x 7000 = 21,000
1 x Concat = 1 x 7000 = 7,000


(specific to each of mha_kernels)
unfused: mma + softmax + mma = 2,550,000 + 400,000 + 2,250,000 = 5,200,000
fa: 13,500,000  (one lane handles 16x4) [WIP towards TC WMMA]
fa_4x4: 7,400,000 (one lane handles 4x4)
fa_4x4_int8: 9,000,000
fa_16x4: WIP - prepared to implement wmma + cp.async
